# Create New Course Folder
 
This project was to automate the process when I start a new course.

run this python script with your course name, I use my course name in the format of X999 but you could use anything without a space.

The script creates a folder in the directory, copies the calendar in the base folder over to course foler, and renames the file to  "course calendar".

A quick update allows you to script multiple courses at once either as an arguement in the command line or interactive mode
