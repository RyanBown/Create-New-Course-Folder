# Create New Course Folder
 
This project was to automate the process when I start a new course.

The calendar included is  Excel Template that can be changed to what ever start of the week you want and will reflect what year you are planning on.
Please configure the template to how you want it before running the script.


run this python script with your course name, I use my course name in the format of X999 but you could use anything without a space.

The script creates a folder in the directory, copies the calendar in the base folder over to course foler, and renames the file to  "course calendar".

A quick update allows you to script multiple courses at once either as an arguement in the command line or interactive mode
